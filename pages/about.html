<br>
<p>Welcome to my website</p>
<br>
<p>You can call me Skipper, and this is where I share some of my thoughts and creations.<br> I am here to have fun, please join me.</p> 
<br>
<p>Many of the things I create were born from art challenges and games, 
	<br>which are held on a regular basis in the Refresh discord server and other places.
	<br> In addition, I am also interested in exploring the nature of art on the blockchain: 
	<br> juxtaposing binary and written code with the images that are either produced from this
	<br> or derived from somewhere else.</p>
<br>
<p>I have a background in theatre as an actor, director, producer, and playwright; 
<br>and I work on early modern visual culture in Europe. Recently, I started coding 
<br>to gain a better understanding and appreciation of on chain art. 
<br>Now, I am beginning to create some things of my own. I would love to hear your thoughts. 
<br>Please feel free to ask me any questions</p>
<br>
<p>Bon voyage, Godspeed, and happy landing!</p>
<br>
<p>Skipper</p>
