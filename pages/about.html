<article><h2>Ship ahoy!  â›µ</h2> 

<p>Welcome to my channel, within the wonderful world of The Refresh!

You can call me Skipper, and this is where I share some of my thoughts and creations. I am here to have fun, please join me.</p> 

<p>Many of the things I create were born from art challenges and games, which are held on a regular basis in the Refresh discord server and other places. In addition, I am also interested in exploring the nature of art on the blockchain: juxtaposing binary and written code with the images that are either produced from this or derived from somewhere else.</p>

<p>I have a background in theatre as an actor, director, producer, and playwright; and I work on early modern visual culture in Europe. Recently, I started coding to gain a better understanding and appreciation of on chain art. Now, I am beginning to create some things of my own. On this journey, the Refresh has been a great source of inspiration; and its creator and community have been incredibly supportive. So, I am happy to be here in this server and I hope you will be too.</p>

<p>Bon voyage, Godspeed, and happy landing!</p>

<p>Please feel free to ask me any questions</p></article>
